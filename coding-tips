Sharing some important observations to be remembered while doing CP:

1. If the input array is sorted then go for
- Binary search
- Two pointers method

2. If asked for all permutations/subsets then
- Backtracking approach

3. If given a tree then go for
- DFS traversal(Inorder,Preorder,postorder)
- BFS traversal

4. If given a graph then
- DFS traversal
- BFS traversal

5. If given a linked list then
- slow and fast pointers
-sentinel node

6. If asked for common strings then
- Map
- Trie

7. If recursion cannot be used then go for
- Stack (Iterative approach)

8. If asked to solve in-place then
- Swap corresponding values
- Store one or more different values in the same pointer

9.If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then
- Dynamic programming(Memoization/Top-down)

10. If you are asked to find top/least K elements then go for
- Heap(Min or Max based on problem)
